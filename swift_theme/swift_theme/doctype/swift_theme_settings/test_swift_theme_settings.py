"""Regression tests for Swift Theme.

Each test maps to a defect that shipped silently: the desk JS gated on Settings
fields that no longer existed, the login page called whitelisted methods as
Guest, and several CSS attribute values had no rule behind them. None of those
raised an exception — they quietly did nothing, which is exactly the class of
bug that needs a test rather than a manual check.

Two deliberate choices about *how* things are asserted:

* Guest access is checked against ``frappe.guest_methods`` rather than by
  calling the function. ``allow_guest`` is enforced by the HTTP layer only, so
  a direct Python call succeeds regardless and would prove nothing.
* Browser behaviour is asserted against the shipped JS source. These are
  contract checks, not a substitute for real JS tests — but the bug this app
  actually had was "Python publishes an event and nothing listens", which a
  Python-only suite cannot see.
